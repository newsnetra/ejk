He claimed that criminals opened fire when the RAB team entered the building and the team fired back in self-defense. After the shooting ended, RAB discovered a body, which they identified as Kamrul Islam. The deceased’s family disputed the RAB claim, saying the victim’s name was Kaiser Mahmud, and not Kamrul Islam. Kaiser, 24, also had the common nickname of \"Bappi\". An autopsy conducted on September 11, 2009 identified the deceased as Kamruzzaman Bappi instead of Kaiser Mahmud or even Kamrul Islam. Later, a probe committee formed by the Home Ministry found that Bappi did not die in crossfire, as reported to the media by RAB. The probe report refuted most of the other claims made by RAB. It concluded that it was evident that Kaiser Mahmud was wrongfully killed by RAB due to a mistake.",

Sensing the presence of the law enforcers, Jamaat-Shibir men opened fire on the joint forces, while the law enforcers fired gunshots in response. At one stage, Jabbar who was staying with the team during the raids, jumped out of the police van to flee the scene, and caught in the line of fire.",

Major Shahid Sarwar of RAB-7 said the incident occurred when a RAB team was patrolling the Dhaka-Chittagong highway and came across a pick-up van on Port-Bhatiary link road at 2. 45 am. They saw two people in the van and asked them to stop as they were trying to drive away. At that time the two men opened fire at the RAB team, and a gunfight followed. The pick up managed to flee after a while. Later, RAB members found Zahidul's bullet-riddled body. He was rushed to Chittagong Medical College Hospital only to be declared dead on arrival. Family members refuted the Rab statement, calling it a cooked-up story. Yasmin Akhter, wife of the deceased, said her husband was abducted by 7-8 people in plainclothes from a friend's house in Dhaka at around 8. 00 am on August 15, 2015.",

The dead, Bachchu Mia, was a CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver who had been traceless since being \"detained by plainclothes officials\" on February 17, according to his family members. The family has been making this allegation since the day after his \"detention\". Bachchu was one of the accused in the case filed with Bahubal Police Station in connection with the killing of the four schoolboys. Kazi Moniruzzaman, Company Commander of RAB-9, claimed that they had detained Shaheed, one of the accomplices of Bacchu. A team of the elite force conducted a drive in Dawargachh area to arrest Bacchu as Shaheed informed them that he was preparing to flee to India. Sensing the presence of RAB members, Bachchu along with his accomplices \"opened fire on them\". The RAB team fired back, triggering the \"gunfight\", the official said. Later, the bullet-hit body of Bachchu was found and sent to Chunarughat Upazila Health Complex for autopsy. But the family members turned down the Rab version. \"My husband never touched a gun, let alone operate it. How come he engaged in gunfight?\" said Bachchu's wife Rina Akther in a tearful voice. She alleged that two men in plainclothes on the afternoon of February 17 came to their house at Sundrateki village of the district looking for her husband. \"After talking to them outside the house, my husband came back and told me that police asked him to meet them for some reasons. He did not tell me the reasons and went away, \" After a while, she called her husband on his mobile phone, but he was not picking it up. At one stage, she found the phone switched off, Rina said. Contacted repeatedly, police could not provide any information on him, she added. Bachchu's mother Elai Bibi alleged that it was the RAB that picked up her son and killed him. \"My son was not involved in the killings. Even if he had been involved in the murders, court was there to try him. Why did he have to die without trial?\" she said.",

Karim, 35, of Adhariatola village under Munshiganj Sadra upazila, was sent to DMCH for treatment from Munshiganj jail on July 21, 2016 due to a severe chest pain, said Farid Uddin Rubel, jailer of Munshiganj jail.

Karim was first admitted to Munshiganj General Hospital for treatment and later sent to DMCH, the jailer added. Karim's wife Moyna Begum said a house was being built by their neighbour Md Shamim; Karim along with others wanted some money from him for arranging a picnic earlier this month. Later, Shamim and his relative Khorshed Alam took Karim to Shamim's office at Adhariatola and beat him mercilessly and handed him to the cops on July 10, she alleged. She also alleged that a sub-inspector of Munshiganj Sadar Police Station tortured Karim at the station and damaged a part of his ear. Shamim also filed an extortion case against Karim the same day and police sent him to Munshiganj jail on July 11, she said. Moyna alleged that Karim's younger brother Abdus Salam Khan, who was also detained in Munshiganj jail in another case, told her Karim was groaning due to stomach pain on July 22, but when they called a doctor from the local hospital he said that Karim had no problem. Sonjoy Kumar Poddar, a doctor of Munshiganj General Hospital, said as Karim was seriously sick, he was sent to DMCH for better treatment. When asked about the reason behind his sickness, the doctor said that they did not perform any test on Karim before sending him to DMCH. Yunus Ali, officer-in-charge of Munshiganj Sadar Police Statiion, refuted the allegation, saying that police did not torture him.",

He left home for Dhaka at 6:00pm on July 9, 2016. He was travelling by a bus bound for Dhaka from Kaliganj. Habibullah claimed that police picked up Oliullah from the bus in Devhata Parulia area. Later, he came to know that his brother had been killed in police firing, he added. Police denied the allegation.",

After the gun battle, the RAB team found a bullet-hit man and took him to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Victim's family, however, said Kalam went outside his rented house in Baizid area on July 18 morning, saying he was going to work. But he did not return home at night. Md Ripon, the elder brother of Kalam's wife, said, \"In the morning, we came to know about his [Kalam] death from TV news. Family members of Kalam asked me to see whether Kalam was alright. I came to the hospital and identified his body. \" \"My sister's husband [Kalam] used to catch fish and look after their cattle in his village in Feni. He came here [Chittagong city] around six months ago. He used to work as a daily labourer. On July 18 morning, he told my sister that he was going to work in a vehicle as a helper, \" Ripon said.

Wari Police Station Officer-in-Charge Rafiqul Islam, however, claimed that Rakib was 22-year-old and was the prime suspect in killing of Daffodil University student Khandaker Abu Talha in October 2017. Police officials said that he was earlier arrested on October 10, 2017 just two days after the killing of Talha. Wari police station sub-inspector Shah Alam claimed that a group of eight or nine suspected muggers opened fire on a police patrol team behind Bangladesh Homeopathic Medical College Hospital at about 3:20am. Police also retaliated by firing triggering a gunfight. After the gunfight the police found bullet-hit Rakib.

The area is around 60 km away from Jasim's house. The OC said they did not know Jasim and therefore could not identify the body immediately. \"We're suspecting that he was killed during a clash between two criminal groups, \" the OC said, adding that they sent the body to Kapasia Upazila Health Complex where the duty doctor declared him dead. Kapasia Union Parishad member Abdul Motaleb said police called him over the phone around 3:30am and asked him to go to the spot where he found a blood-stained body and a pistol. Jasim's wife Happy Akhtar Chhaya claimed a sub-inspector (SI) of Mouchak police outpost in Kaliakoir called her husband out on 7 September afternoon. SI Saiful Islam, who was acquainted with her husband, called Jasim to show his new car, Chhaya claimed. SI Rezaul Karim of Detective Branch (DB) of Police was with Saiful at that time. She further said that she spoke to SI Saiful over the phone twice that night, and offered \"whatever they want\" to speak to her husband. Contacted, SI Saiful denied the allegation of calling Jasim out of the home.",

Major Mehedi Hasan, Deputy Director of Rab-7 told The Daily Star that the gunfight took place at Chhoto Chonua area of Banshkhali upazila at around 4:00am. He said acting on a tip-off, a patrol team of Rab raided the area where the robbers were preparing to commit robbery in the sea-bound fishing trawlers. Sensing presence of the law enforcers, the robbers opened fire on them, forcing them to fire back, triggering a gunfight. Later, RAB members recovered Taleb's body and handed it over to Banshkhali Police Station.",

The incident took place when a RAB team signalled a CNG-run autorickshaw to stop at a checkpoint in front of the National Institute of Kidney Diseases and Urology around 12:15am, said Mohammad Mohiuddin Faruqui, company commander of RAB-2. As the RAB men asked the three passengers and the driver to get off the vehicle, all but Shahin followed the instruction, the RAB official said. When the RAB men were forcing Shahin to come out, the others suddenly fired blank shots and tried to escape by crossing the adjacent boundary walls of National Institute of Mental Health and Hospital. RAB members were forced to fire back when Shahin also started firing on them from inside the autorickshaw, triggering a \"gunfight\", Faruqui said. Hanif caught a bullet injury during the incident and was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where doctors declared him dead.",

Since we didn't have the money, they took my father to Muktagacha Police Station where he was tortured mercilessly. \" After Altaf was released on bail on March 7, he lost his appetite and couldn't sleep. But the family couldn't afford to take him to a hospital, said Sirajul Islam, brother-in-law of Altaf. \"As his condition deteriorated, we were taking him to Muktagacha Upazila Health Complex but he died on the way, \" said Sirajul.

Shanu was found hanging from the ceiling fan in Inspector Manoranjan's room on 26 March 2020 morning, according to Bashar. He added that Shanu was taken to the bathroom by a constable around 6:30am. But he sneaked out of the bathroom moments later and hung himself. Manoranjan and Arifur were suspended for the allegations of Shanu's death. A three member committee headed by Additional SP also formed and asked to submit report in three days.",

Amir Ali, a workers' leader of Rupali Bangla Jute Mills, said the mill authorities announced to shut down the mills without any prior notice amid corona virus outbreak. The workers demonstrated in and around the mill demanding their three weeks arrears, he added. At one point, the director of the mill tried to pacify the workers with police, resulting in the clash, he added. Sheikh Mohammad Nasim Habib, officer-in-charge of Biral Police Station, said they had to fire rubber bullets, tear shells and charge baton to take the situation under control. Surat suffered injuries during the clash and later died. Meanwhile, Abdul Kader, sub inspector of that police station, filed a case accusing 1100 unnamed people in connection with the incident.",

On January 1, he said, they received a phone call from the hospital and the caller told them that his son was admitted to the prison cell as there was excessive bleeding through his urinary system.

Earlier this month, at least two Rohingyas were killed in reported gunfights with the Border Guard Bangladesh at Naikhyangchari upazila in Bandarban.",

It said that a group of 30 to 40 suspected smugglers, armed with sharp weapons and sticks, attacked the BGB personnel on way to BOP, and snatched two sacks of the seized bidi. Though the BGB personnel warned the attackers, the attackers went violent and tried to snatch the remaining bidi forcing the BGB men to open fire in the air, the release said. It claimed that the suspected smugglers then tried to snatch the BGB personnel’s firearms when the BGB personnel, to save their lives and government properties, opened a fire that killed Badrul.",

The clash took place when a team of River Police was conducting a regular drive against jatka netting. Mohammad Kamruzzaman, a member of Chandpur River Police, said while patrolling in the Meghna river they chased a group of fishermen, who were catching jatka. Being chased by the law enforcers, the fishermen threw brick chips on them, prompting the police team to fire shotguns in self-defence, adding that Masud was hit by a bullet in his left thigh. After the clash, police detained bullet-hit Masud and two other fishermen from the spot. Later, Masud was taken to Matlab North Upazila Health Complex, from where he was shifted to DMCH as his condition deteriorated.",

The incident happened around 7:00am near the ticket sales centre of an intercity bus operator. The area is covered by CCTV cameras of different nearby shops and businesses. Employees of these shops told this correspondent yesterday afternoon that Rab officials had deleted the footage and didn’t let anyone see what had been recorded. According to Mohiuddin, RAB officers were waiting there after being tipped off about a man arriving from Cox’s Bazar with a yaba haul. After the bus arrived and the other passengers had left, Iqbal was waiting there with at least 12 bags, Mohiuddin said. At one point, sensing their presence, Iqbal started to shoot at the RAB members who then retaliated. He was killed during the shootout. Iqbal was accused in at least six drugs cases, Rab claimed.",
